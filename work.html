        <p>Read the short story selections here. Choose <br>one short story and set the text using HTML and<br> CSS (JS optional) so that the reader will not only be able to read the story but also experience your interpretation of the story. Use the visual language <br> of the web—hypertext, responsive design, forms,<br> color, divs—to express the meaning of your<br> selected story.</p>

                  <br>
                 <p>For this project, we’ll make use of Airtable’s API <br>to design and build a website to contain and display<br> your peer’s content. Keep in mind that you’re not <br>designing a fixed, unchanging website: you’re <br>designing a system that can expand or contract <br> to show this collection as it changes. Always think <br> about WHAT you want to do and WHY, and then HOW.</p>

        <h2><span class="tocnumb">05</span><a href="projects/p3_clock.html">  Project O4 </h2>
          <p>Create a set of rules which lead your website to generate contents and form by audience’s input. You use HTML, CSS and JS to make the website. What is your idea and how does it connect to your rule? Who is your audience and how do they interact on the web? Is your idea presented in the final typography and form?

          In this project, we’ll explore the boundaries of what a tool can be when it is made on the web. It is very important that you test and try to use the tool you make. Ask as many people as possible to play with it. It will help you improve the tool.</p>
