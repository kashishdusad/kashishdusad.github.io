    <p id="about_her">Felicitas Gómez Martínez de Mendez (February 5, 1916 – April 12, 1998) was a Puerto Rican activist in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement">American civil rights movement</a>. In 1946, Mendez and her husband Gonzalo led an educational civil rights battle that changed California and set an important legal precedent for ending <em>de jure</em> segregation in the United States. Their landmark desegregation case, known as Mendez v. Westminster, paved the way for meaningful integration and public school reform.</p>
