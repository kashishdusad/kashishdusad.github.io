    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <p>Prepare a campfire or charcoal for cooking.

    In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper until thoroughly blended. Set aside.

    Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 10” skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and saute until soft and beginning to brown, 7-10 minutes.

    Reduce the heat to medium-low by raising your campfire grate or moving the skillet to the cooler side of the grill. Add the tomatoes to the skillet, followed by the egg mixture, basil, and cheese. Cover with a lid. Scatter a few embers across the lid.

    Cook until the frittata has puffed up and the eggs are just set, about 15 minutes (check at 10 minutes to gauge progress, using heat proof gloves or a lid lifter to remove the lid).

    Serve with additional cheese and basil if desired and enjoy! </p>
